This mod merges few modded throwers into one class.

Current supported classes:
1. Thrower (Thorium or any other mod that uses vanilla thrower)
2. Rogue (Calamity and it's addons)
3. Revenant (Kinetic damage from Shadows of Abaddon)
4. Blood Hunter (Vitality)

This mod is highly configurable. You can toggle only specific classes merge, tooltip overrides, color for Colored Damage Types support.
If you playing with mod that also merges throwers make sure to turn off their thrower merge if possible.
This mod DOES NOT add stealth strikes for non-Calamity weapons so it is recomended to use mods like WHummus' Calamity/Thorium Balancing that add stealth strikes for other mods.
